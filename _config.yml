An experienced full stack web developer currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Utah, I'm also concurrently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Systems Security Lab, focusing on context-aware vulnerabilities in high-performance computing environments. Previous to this, I worked as a full stack developer for ~3 years. Technologies I have worked in include Node.js, .NET, React, and WebAPI.
